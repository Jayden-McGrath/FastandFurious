<h2>Dominic "Dom" Toretto is a fictional character and one of the two main protagonists of the Fast and Furious franchise. He is portrayed by Vin Diesel and first appeared on film with fellow protagonist Brian O'Conner in The Fast and the Furious (2001). Dominic was created by screenwriter Gary Scott Thompson, who was inspired by an article on street racing that was published in the May 1998 issue of Vibe magazine, while Diesel was heavily sought after to play the character.</h2>

<h2>As the patriarch of a group of street racers, Dom acts as an influential voice, being forced into the role as primary caregiver following his father's untimely passing. As the leader, he initially worked as an auto mechanic, but eventually progressed to orchestrating carjackings, a multi-million dollar heist, and illicit jobs for government agencies.</h2>

<h2>Dominic is gruff, strong, and possesses a volatile temper, especially when his family is in danger. He preaches morality and loyalty, and in many cases is also seen to be affectionate and religious. He is married to Letty Ortiz, with whom he raises a son.[3] He is also implied to be the group's strongest and most skilled racer, a title that is challenged persistently by Brian.</h2>
